# Simple visitor framework for Nit models.
#
# This module provides the `ModelVisitor` abstract class and
# refines the classes of the `MEntity` hierarchy to add visiting related methods.
#
# A standard approach on complex visitor is to dispatch the `ModelVisitor::visit` on the
# entities to do specific things.
